# How to Install
- Just Drag and Drop into ur Project, u might have to replace a few things cuz i had to change a few things in the SDK
           - WARNING, I INCULDED A REPLACEMENT FOR THE JOIN / LEAVE PATCH, AS BY DEFAULT THE LEAVE PATCH WAS BROKEN, IF U HAVE STUFF IN UR JOIN/ LEAVE, I'D BACK UP THE FILE BEFORE REPLACING
